  - Initial submission.
  - There is currently no publication associated with this package and therefore
    no `doi` to report in `DESCRIPTION` file.
  - I get one `NOTE` about invalid URLs but these URLs will be active once the
    package is available on `CRAN`.
  - Although in the past I have been encouraged to not have the `LICENSE` file
    at the top level directory, I prefer to do this because most people explore
    this package on `GitHub` and, in such cases, the LICENSE file is easily
    accessible.
