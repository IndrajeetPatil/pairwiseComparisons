# pairwiseComparisons 0.1.2

MINOR CHANGES

  - With `jmv 1.0.8`, the results from the Dwass-Steel-Crichtlow-Fligner test
    will be slightly different.

# pairwiseComparisons 0.1.1

BREAKING CHANGES

  - The `p.value.label` in the output dataframe has been renamed to `label` to
    consider the possibility that Bayes Factor tests might also be supported in
    future.
  - The label now specified whether the *p*-value was adjusted or not for
    multiple comparisons.

# pairwiseComparisons 0.1.0

  - First release of the package.
